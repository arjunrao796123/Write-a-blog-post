There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.


Project Motivation
For this project, I was interestested in using Stack Overflow data from 2020 to better understand:

1. How companies are treating people of different sex?
2. Whether people of different sex are having similar job satisfaction or not?
3. How organizations of different sizes treate people of all genders?
4. What is the experience level of differrent sexes at organizations of different sizes.
